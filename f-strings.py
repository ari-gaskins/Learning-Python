# f strings
# f strings are new, brought into python 3.6
# they are useful in embedding operations or numbers in a string
# just type f before initializing the string and in curly braces put the operations or numbers
# it evaluates what is in the braces and converts them to strings
x = f'the answer is {6 + 8}'

# prints 'the answer is 14'
print(x)
